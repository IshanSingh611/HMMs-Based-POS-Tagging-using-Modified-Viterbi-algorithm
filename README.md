# HMMs-Based-POS-Tagging-using-Modified-Viterbi-algorithm

# Problem Statement

The vanilla Viterbi algorithm we had written had resulted in ~87% accuracy. The approx. 13% loss of accuracy was majorly due to the fact that when the algorithm encountered an unknown word (i.e. not present in the training set, such as 'Twitter'), it assigned an incorrect tag arbitrarily. 

# Business Objective

You need to modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. Though there could be multiple ways to solve this problem
- Which tag class do you think most unknown words belong to? Can you identify rules (e.g. based on morphological cues) that can be used to tag unknown words? 
- Why does the Viterbi algorithm choose a random tag on encountering an unknown word? Can you modify the Viterbi algorithm so that it considers only one of the transition or emission probabilities for unknown words?

# Data 

For this, youâ€™ll use the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.

# Goals

- Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
- Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
- Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
- List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
